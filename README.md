# The Technical Notebook shows the workflow for the final model and is the
# primary submission for this Capstone Project.# 
# Other Notebooks are refernced and show alternative models and workflow
# for functions used in feature engineering
#
# Notebook1 shows a train test split prepared for the justice level datasets tha# contains the same cases the train and test sets created for the case level 
# datasets.  

# Notebook2 shows my comparison of a logistic regression, nearest neighbor and 
# random forest model.  I

# Notebook3 shows my work with a gradient boost model
# Notenook4 shows my work on a neural network that did not outperform the
# random forest

# Notebook5: Shows how I created training sets with multiple training sets
# with different starting points -- the 1920 dataset specifically.\

# Notebook6: shows my work with an SVM model.

# Notebook7: shows the code I used to create dummy variables for the justices
# Various csv files that I used for my data and to implement functions are also in the
# repository
